   Exercise 1.3.6. G  i  v  e  n s e t s A and B, d e f i n e
   A+B = {a+b: a ∈ A and b ∈ B}. Follow these steps t o prove
   that i f A and B are nonempty and b o u n d e d above then
   sup(A + B) = sup A + sup B.

   (a) Let s = sup A and t = sup B. S h o w s + t is an upper
       bound for A + B.

       if a + b ∈ A + B t h e n a + b ≤ sup A + sub B = s + t

   (b) N o w let u be an arbitrary upper bound for A + B, and
       temporarily fix a ∈ A. Show t ≤ u − a.

       a + b ≤ u, so b ≤ u - a, that is u - a is an u p p e r
       bound for B, by definition sub B = t ≤ u - a

   (c) Finally, show sup(A + B) = s + t.

       from (a) we have that s + t is an upper bound of A + B
       from (b) that if u is an upper bound f o r A + B, then
       t ≤ u - a, f o r a n y a ∈ A, t h a t is a ≤ u - t, so
       u - t is a n upper bound f o r A and sup A = s ≤ u - t,
       so s + t ≤ u

   (d) Construct another proof o f this same fact using Lemma
       1.3.8.

       The lema is saying that if A is bounded above and s is
       an u p p e r bound, s = sup A if and only if for every
       ε > 0, there exist a n a ∈ A: s - ε < a, that is s - ε
       is no longer a n upper bound, so we have to prove that
       s + t is an upper bound for A + B which we already did
       and that for every ε > 0, s + t - ε is no longer a sup:
       s + t - ε = s - ε/2 + t - ε/2 < a + b f o r some a ∈ A
       and b ∈ B, be c a u s e s = sup A, a n d s - ε/2 is no
       longer a sup t h a t is there is an a ∈ A: s - ε/2 < a,
       same for B
